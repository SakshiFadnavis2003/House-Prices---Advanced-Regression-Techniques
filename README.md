# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

## Overview
This project is a solution to the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques". The goal is to predict the final prices of houses based on various features.

## Competition
[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

## Data
The data used in this project is provided by Kaggle. It includes various features of houses and their corresponding sale prices. The data can be accessed from the competition's page on Kaggle.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- lightgbm

Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn lightgbm
```

## Usage
To run the project, use the following command:

```bash
HousePrices.ipynb
```

## Implementation Details
- **Algorithm**: LightGBM was chosen for its efficiency in handling large datasets with categorical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: The dataset underwent preprocessing steps to handle missing values and categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Cross-validation techniques were employed to optimize model hyperparameters.
- **Scoring**: The model was evaluated based on the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric, achieving a score of XXX on the validation set.

## Credits
This project was developed as part of the Kaggle competition. The code and approach are shared for educational purposes.
